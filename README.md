# Landing Page Template

This project is a Next.js implementation of a landing page template based on the Figma design by [Flux with Ran Segall](https://www.youtube.com/flux-with-ran-segall). The original design can be found [here](<https://www.figma.com/design/o5yDdlE9zbD4pFLg7VTiax/Landing-Page-Structure-Template-(Community)?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas&t=tdVqDzx3Mnogz8BF-0>).

## About the Project

This landing page template showcases a modern and responsive design, implemented using Next.js for optimal performance and SEO. It serves as a great starting point for creating attractive and functional landing pages for various purposes.

## Technologies Used

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the components and styles to fit your specific needs. The structure follows the original Figma design, but you can easily adapt it to your requirements.
